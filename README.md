# Frontend

Under `app/` is the frontend stuff.  The frontend is an Angular app.

## Todo

Admit patient, Update patient, Discharge patient, refuse admission, transfer patient, connect it all to the backend

Small things: Command + f "TODO"

# Backend

See `server.go`.  The backend is, obviously, in Go.
